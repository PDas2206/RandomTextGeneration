# RandomTextGeneration
In this project, we reimplement the "Dissociated Press" system that was developed by MIT students in the 1970s (see Wikipedia). The purpose of this system is to generate random text from an n-gram model over a corpus. We train an instance of the n-gram class (sourced from piazza) using the corpus text2 (the novel *Sense and Sensibility* by Jane Austen) in *nltk.book* and name it **ngram**. We then use *ngram[context]* to determine the probability distribution for the next word given the previous *n-1* words. Given this distribution, we use the method *generate* from the NLTK class **ProbDistI** to generate the next random word. We vary *n* from 2 to 4.
